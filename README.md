The Patrician
======

Welcome to the Patrician brought back from Davy Jones' Locker with all its retro glory!  

The original Patrician is suprisingly deep and engaging.  Subsequent releases of this series converted the Patrician to a top down trading simulator in vein of similar games that were becoming popular at the time.  Now with touchscreen support, the first person presentation of the Patrician returns the aspiring medieval merchant to lumbering around in their ship, shifting goods from port to port, funding new ship builds and expanding production.
